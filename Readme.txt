I've tested SaveCam 1.0 with Internet Exploter 6 and Netscape 7
It worked for me..lol

Everythink has been comment...
Sorry for my bad english, you maybe find some typing errors...
I prever dutch..lol

The first time you start Savecam it's making 2 maps.. 
1> Snapshot 'For your snapshot's you can take
2> Data 'for the server data, This map will be deleted if you close the app

The map come in de app.path
At the first time you start savecam it's making a default settings file..
This you can edit by settings...

The settings file will be encoded when you save it..

Just take a look at the source...
